# ChIP-seq Analysis of RUNX1 Binding in MCF-7 Breast Cancer Cells

## Introduction

Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) is a powerful technique used to identify genome-wide binding sites for transcription factors and other DNA-associated proteins. This study focuses on re-analyzing ChIP-seq data from Barutcu et al. (2016) [1], who investigated RUNX1's role in breast cancer cells. RUNX1 (Runt-related transcription factor 1), while traditionally known for its essential functions in hematopoiesis, has emerged as an important player in breast cancer pathogenesis. The original study aimed to understand how RUNX1 contributes to higher-order chromatin organization and gene regulation in breast cancer cells, particularly examining its role in long-range chromatin interactions and spatial genome architecture. The authors employed ChIP-seq to map RUNX1 binding sites genome-wide and integrated these findings with Hi-C data to explore RUNX1's involvement in chromatin looping and domain organization. The bioinformatic techniques employed including quality control, peak calling, motif discovery, and integration with chromatin architecture data, enable comprehensive characterization of transcription factor binding landscapes and their structural consequences in cancer cells.
